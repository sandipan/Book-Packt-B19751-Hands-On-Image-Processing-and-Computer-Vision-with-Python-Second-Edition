### TL;DR: quickstart
InstructIR takes as input an image and a human-written instruction for how to improve that image. The neural model performs all-in-one image restoration. InstructIR achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement.

<summary> <b> Abstract</b> (click me to read)</summary>
<p>
Image restoration is a fundamental problem that involves recovering a high-quality clean image from its degraded observation. All-In-One image restoration models can effectively restore images from various types and levels of degradation using degradation-specific information as prompts to guide the restoration model. In this work, we present the first approach that uses human-written instructions to guide the image restoration model. Given natural language prompts, our model can recover high-quality images from their degraded counterparts, considering multiple degradation types. Our method, InstructIR, achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement. InstructIR improves +1dB over previous all-in-one restoration methods. Moreover, our dataset and results represent a novel benchmark for new research on text-guided image restoration and enhancement.

## Results

Check `test.py` and `eval_instructir.py`. The following command provides all the metric for all the benchmarks using the pre-trained models in `models/`. The results from InstructIR are saved in the indicated folder `results/`

```
python eval_instructir.py --model models/im_instructir-7d.pt --lm models/lm_instructir-7d.pt --device 0 --config configs/eval5d.yml --save results/
```

An example of the output log is:

```
>>> Eval on CBSD68_15 noise 0
CBSD68_15_base 24.84328738380881
CBSD68_15_psnr 33.98722295200123 68
CBSD68_15_ssim 0.9315137801801457

....
```

You can **[download all the test datasets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11wGsKOMDVrBlsle4xtzORPLZAsGhel8c/view?usp=sharing)**, and locate them in `test-data/`. Make sure the paths are updated in the config file `configs/eval5d.yml`.

### Control and Interact

Sometimes the blur, rain, or film grain noise are pleasant effects and part of the **"aesthetics"**. Here we show a simple example on how to interact with InstructIR.

| Input       |(1) I love this photo, could you remove the raindrops? please keep the content intact | (2) Can you make it look stunning? like a professional photo     |
| ---        |    :----   |          :--- |
| <img src="images/rain-020.png" width=100%>      | <img src="images/results/result1.png" width=95%>       | <img src="images/results/result2.png"  width=100%>   |
|   Input     |(1) my image is too dark, I cannot see anything, can you fix it? | (2) Great it looks nice! can you apply tone mapping?     |
| <img src="images/lol_748.png" width=100%>      | <img src="images/results/resultlol1.png" width=95%>       | <img src="images/results/resultlol2.png" width=100%>   |
|   Input     |(1) can you remove the tiny dots in the image? it is very unpleasant | (2) now please inprove the quality and resolution of the picture |
| <img src="images/frog.png" width=100%>      | <img src="images/results/resultns1.png" width=95%>       | <img src="images/results/resultns2.png" width=100%>   |


As you can see our model accepts diverse humman-written prompts, from ambiguous to precise instructions. *How does it work?* Imagine we have the following image as input:

<img src="images/rain-020.png" width=50%>

Now we can use InstructIR. with the following prompt (1):
> I love this photo, could you remove the raindrops? please keep the content intact

<img src="images/results/result1.png" width=50%>

Now, let's enhance the image a bit further (2).
> Can you make it look stunning? like a professional photo

<img src="images/results/result2.png" width=50%>

The final result looks indeed stunning ðŸ¤— You can do it yourself in the [demo tutorial]().

### FAQS

> Disclaimer: please remember this is not a product, thus, you will notice some limitations. As most all-in-one restoration methods, it struggles to generalize on real-world images -- we are working on improving it.

- ***How should I start?*** Check our [demo Tutorial](demo.ipynb) and also our [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OrTvS-i6uLM2Y8kIkq8ZZRwEQxQFchfq?usp=sharing) notebook.

- ***How can I compare with your method?*** You can download the results for several benchmarks above on [Results](###Results).

- ***How can I test the model? I just want to play with it***: Visit our ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/marcosv/InstructIR) and test ir for free,

- ***Why aren't you using diffusion-based models?*** (1) We want to keep the solution simple and efficient. (2) Our priority is high-fidelity --as in many industry scenarios realted to computational photography--.
